After settinup server by installing node js and express as explained in 
server.js wwe are going to setup angular js in html file:
1- go to angluarjs.org -> download ->copy the text next to CDN
and open a script just before closing the body tag and paste the link in that script (as below)

2- to test angular js type in ng-app and call your app as myApp in html tag:
 <input ng-model="test">  -> this means calling an angular model
	{{test}} -> this means two way binding which angular connect output to input
3- call bootstrap to style your html. FOr this just copy first two paragraph of below link:
	getbootstrap.com -> getting started -> bootstarp CDN part
-->
